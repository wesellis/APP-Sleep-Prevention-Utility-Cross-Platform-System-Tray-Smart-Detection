# SleepFree Content Guidelines & Hypnotic Scripts

## Content Creation Principles

### Core Messaging Framework
1. **Empowerment over Control** - User chooses freedom, not restriction
2. **Identity Transformation** - "I am a non-smoker" vs "I'm trying to quit"
3. **Natural Progression** - Change feels organic, not forced
4. **Positive Association** - Focus on gains, not losses
5. **Safety First** - No aggressive or traumatic content

### Voice and Tone Guidelines
- **Calm and Reassuring** - Like a trusted friend or mentor
- **Confident but Gentle** - Strong conviction without pressure
- **Personal but Respectful** - Uses name when appropriate
- **Present Tense** - "You are" not "You will be"
- **Inclusive Language** - Gender-neutral, culturally sensitive

## Content Adaptation Algorithm

### Learning from User Feedback
```python
class ContentPersonalization:
    def __init__(self):
        self.effectiveness_scores = {}
        self.user_preferences = {}
    
    def track_suggestion_effectiveness(self, user_id, suggestion_id, outcome):
        """
        Tracks how well different suggestion types work for each user
        """
        if user_id not in self.effectiveness_scores:
            self.effectiveness_scores[user_id] = {}
        
        suggestion_type = self.get_suggestion_type(suggestion_id)
        if suggestion_type not in self.effectiveness_scores[user_id]:
            self.effectiveness_scores[user_id][suggestion_type] = []
        
        # Score based on outcome: craving resistance, sleep quality, user rating
        score = self.calculate_effectiveness_score(outcome)
        self.effectiveness_scores[user_id][suggestion_type].append(score)
    
    def generate_next_suggestion(self, user_id, context):
        """
        Selects most effective suggestion type for this user
        """
        user_scores = self.effectiveness_scores.get(user_id, {})
        best_type = max(user_scores, key=lambda x: sum(user_scores[x])/len(user_scores[x]))
        
        return self.create_suggestion(best_type, context)
```
